# **Project Name**:  

Book List

# **Description**: 

The Book List project is a combination of using React components with web components with clean simple code. The manner in which the code was written exemplifies the elimination of repeated code throughout the app. Simplifying the way the code is written improves maintainence because updates only need to happen in one place. For example, by inserting all the book data into a json file, the book data does not need to be hard coded into the app.

The Book List project is an example of my ability to create something that integrates both native web components as well as React components in a way in which the code is simple and easily maintainable. I employed the following: React, Babel transpiler, Javascript, HTML5, and css, which demonstrates my growing skill level, and as such, it is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of similar activities I worked on in August of 2023 in module 17 of the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

I altered the original class work with each iteration of the project. Additionally, I added a link at the bottom of the list of books to allow the user to return to the top of the page. I did this via same page linking and added some styling as well. 

# **Installation and Usage**: 

To run the project on your machine, download the files onto your machine or clone the repo. You will need a server to see your work. So, for example in VSCode (an editor), open the project directory, open the index.html file, and click on LiveServer. 


# **Dependencies**: 

The project relies on the following dependencies: React, Bootstrap, Babel

# **Support**:

# **Roadmap**: 

Future fixes or improvements that would be helpful to a user:

* Adding additional pages to the app and a navbar would improve the project (as well as routing).
